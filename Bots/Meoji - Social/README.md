# How It Works

This is a life simulation bot like no other! Earn money from various ways, become rich, buy and sell properties, and assets. Go to a nightclub and pick up a hooker, and propose to her. Hit the library, become really smart, and get a great job. Start a family, a bike club, or a drug cartel, and invite members of your server. The possibilities are endless.

*All of your progress will be saved across servers.*

*This life is yours.. Will you make the right decisions, become rich, have kids, and pick up a good job along the way?*

*Or will you make the wrong decisions, descend into a life of crime, start prison riots, and start the biggest cartel in the history of discord?*

*It's all up to you...*
